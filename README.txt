This was the first course website for UGBA 96: Data & Decisions (data-centric business course now fulfilling a pre-HAAS admission requirement at UC Berkeley). The website was used to deliver announcements and collect attendance information, but it is no longer active. The website was created with the help/inspiration of PureCSS.
